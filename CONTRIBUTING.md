# Contribute to the Vuetaba project

_TL;DR: PRs are welcome_. There are several possibilities to help us develop Vuetaba:

## Report bugs or request features

All the bugs and feature requests filled by Github issues. There are issue template available. If
something is unclear to you during development, feel free to ask through Github issues.

## Develop features

To contribute directly to the code, fork the project and develop your feature.
There are various features available in the [MVP project](https://github.com/fobo66/vuetaba/projects/1).
When you're done, send us a pull request.

## Write tests

We develop Vuetaba with test coverage in mind. If you think that something is not
enough covered with tests, feel free to let us know via Github issue, and feel free to fix this by yourself and ask us any questions regarding the part of code you want to test. Tests are great tool to learn Elixir, so this type of
contribution might be a good fit for the people who just starts their journey with Elixir.

## Help with documentation

Good documentation makes open source project healthy. We tend to work on docs in
"living docs" style, i.e. write hexdoc comments together with functions or modules. However, there are still a lot of documentation work to do. So, if you would like to fix something in docs or add new hexdoc comments, feel free to open
an issue or submit a PR.
